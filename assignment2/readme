Client sends credit,mark,credit,mark.....
Server claculate GPA and send result to server. 

When client uses ctrl+c , it will terminate it's  connection only.

to run this code:

#Compile 
$gcc client.c -o c.out
$gcc server.c -o s.out

#Run , 2000 is the port number to listen for
$./s.out 2000
$./c.out 127.0.0.1 2000
